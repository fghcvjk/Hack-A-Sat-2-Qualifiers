A cubesat has 6 solar sensors, one on each side of the satellite. At any given time, the sun can be observed by a maximum of 3 sensors at a time. The combination of measurements from 3 sensors provides the sun vector in the spacecraft coordinate system.

The spacecraft coordinate system is a Cartesian system with the origin at the center of the satellite. The sun vector, in combination with other observations such as the Earth magnetic field vector can be used to determine the full 3D attitude of the spacecraft.

During launch, the mounting angle of one of the sun sensors shifted and is no longer aligned with the spacecraft coordinate system's axis causing the sun vector determination to be wrong.

Determine which of the 6 sensors was shifted and find it's vector norm in order to make corrections to the attitude determination. To get the flag, find the correct vector norm of the shifted solar sensor.

Given information:

    6 solar sensors on a CubeSat, one on each face. In spacecraft coordinates the vector norms should be (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (-1,0,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,-1).
    One of the sensors shifted and is no longer aligned with the axis of the satellite.
    Assume the satellite is always 1 A.U. (Astronomical Unit) distance from the sun).
    Each solar sensor has a 1 square cm area and a 10% efficiency. A 10 ohm resistor is used as a voltmeter.
