Guardians of theâ€¦, 436 points

Back to Scoreboard

We've lost control of our spacecraft, Spinny, and it no longer points its directional antenna at our ground stations. You'll need to account for the spacecraft spin rates, as well as its orbit to upload the correct command sequence from ground stations around the world. In order to stop spinning, you'll need to send the following commands in the correct order:

CMD1: "PLEASE"
CMD2: "STOP"
CMD3: "SPINNING!"

Due to Spinny's limited radio capabilities, it requires contact windows of at least 3 minutes and can only receive one word at a time. The spacecraft antenna must be pointed within 45 degrees of a ground station to receive. Since you cannot point the spacececraft, you will have to predict when it will be pointed at a ground station based on a known initial pointing vector and constant body spin rates.

Constant spacecraft body spin rate of [0.1,0.1,0.1] rad/s in XYZ
Initial spacecraft antenna pointing direction of [1,0,0] in the J2000 frame at the TLE epoch (2021-06-26 00:00:00 UTC)

Commands are queued at ground stations using the following format:

SYNTAX: YYYY-MM-DD-hh:mm:ss-UTC STATION CMD SAT CMD_WORD

EXAMPLES:

2021-06-26-01:00:00-UTC BANGALOR CMD SPINNY PLEASE
2021-06-26-02:00:00-UTC GRIMSTAD CMD SPINNY STOP
2021-06-26-03:00:00-UTC SVALBARD CMD SPINNY SPINNING!

Spinny's TLE is:

Ground stations are located at (WGS-84):
Name 	Latitude (deg) 	Longitude (deg) 	Altitude (m)
BANGALOR 	13.0344 	77.5116 	823
GRIMSTAD 	58.33 	8.35 	211
SVALBARD 	78.2307 	15.3897 	497
TROLLSAT 	-72.0117 	2.53838 	1400
TROMSO 	69.6625 	18.9408 	134

Correctly queue commands at the ground stations over 12 hours to rescue Spinny and get the flag.
